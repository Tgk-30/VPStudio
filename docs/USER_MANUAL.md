# VPStudio User Manual

This manual explains the day-to-day use of VPStudio on Vision Pro.

## 0) Before You Launch

If you have not downloaded and built the app yet, complete the Setup section in the project README first:

- `README.md` -> `Setup`

Minimum requirements:

- Apple Silicon Mac
- Xcode 26.1+ with visionOS simulator runtime
- Internet connection for first package resolution

Quick install summary:

1. Download ZIP from GitHub and unzip.
2. Open `VPStudio.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
3. Select `VPStudio` scheme and `Apple Vision Pro Simulator`.
4. Press `Cmd+R`.

## 1) Quick Start (First 5 Minutes)

1. Launch VPStudio.
2. In the first-run prompt, choose:
   - `Browse Library` to browse local sections immediately, or
   - `Run Setup` to configure services now.
3. Open `Discover` or `Search`.
4. Add an item to your Library, Watchlist, or Favorites.
5. Open an item and start playback.

Optional setup for full streaming features:

1. Open `Settings` -> `Quick Actions` -> `Run Setup Wizard`.
2. Add TMDB and Debrid credentials.
3. Configure optional Trakt/AI/Subtitles integrations.
4. Use the Simkl settings screen only to review or clear saved authorization; Simkl is cleanup-only in this build and sync/scrobbling are unavailable.

## 2) Main Navigation

VPStudio is organized into these main areas:

- `Discover`: trending content and curated recommendations.
- `Search`: title search and browsing results.
- `Library`: your saved content and imports.
- `Downloads`: downloaded items and progress state.
- `Environments` (visionOS): immersive environment controls; selection remains unstable.
- `Settings`: integrations, sync, playback, and app configuration.

## 3) Importing Content

1. Go to `Library`.
2. Select the import action.
3. Choose your file or folder source (for example CSV export files).
4. Confirm the import destination or target folder.
5. Wait for completion, then refresh the view if needed.

If expected items do not appear:

1. Check file format and column structure.
2. Re-run import on a small sample file first.
3. Use refresh/reconciliation actions in Library to normalize titles.

## 4) Library Management

Use Library to organize and maintain your media:

- Create and manage folders/subfolders.
- Sort and filter content.
- Open item details.
- Remove items you no longer need.

Tip: keep folder names short and consistent so imports map cleanly.

## 5) Watchlist, Favorites, and History

- `Watchlist`: items you plan to watch later.
- `Favorites`: quick-access list for priority titles.
- `History`: recently played items and resume points.

Recommended flow:

1. Save from Discover/Search to Watchlist.
2. Promote important titles to Favorites.
3. Use History to continue playback from where you left off.

## 6) Search

1. Open `Search`.
2. Enter title keywords.
3. Review matches.
4. Add results directly to Library/Watchlist/Favorites.

If search feels slow, refine keywords and avoid very broad single-word queries.

## 7) Player Basics

During playback you can:

- Play/pause
- Seek forward/back
- Adjust volume
- Select subtitles/audio when available
- Resume from saved progress

If playback fails on a stream:

1. Back out and re-open the item.
2. Try an alternate source/stream option.
3. Check provider credentials in Settings.

## 8) Settings and Integrations

Common configuration areas:

- TMDB metadata key
- Debrid provider tokens
- Trakt sync
- Simkl cleanup-only surface in this build
- AI provider preferences (optional)
- Subtitle provider setup
- Playback behavior

If onboarding needs to be repeated, use:

- `Settings` -> `Quick Actions` -> `Run Setup Wizard`

## 9) Sync

When sync is configured:

- Watch progress and list changes can be mirrored through configured services such as Trakt.
- Token/auth expiration can stop sync until reconnected.

Simkl note:

- Simkl is cleanup-only in this build, so you can review or clear saved authorization.
- Simkl sync and scrobbling are unavailable in this build.

If sync appears stale:

1. Re-check account connection status.
2. Re-authenticate affected service.
3. Trigger a manual sync/refresh action.

## 10) Troubleshooting

### Import completed but nothing appears

1. Confirm the target folder/view is correct.
2. Run refresh/reconciliation in Library.
3. Re-import a known-good sample file to isolate format issues.

### Metadata missing

1. Verify TMDB key.
2. Confirm network access.
3. Re-open the affected title.

### App performance drops

1. Reduce simultaneous imports/downloads.
2. Restart VPStudio.
3. Re-test with a smaller content set.

### Setup loop or blank startup states

1. Use `Browse Library` to bypass setup and confirm the app opens normally.
2. Re-run setup later from Settings.
3. If needed, relaunch app.

## 11) FAQ

### Do I need all integrations to use VPStudio?
No. You can browse local sections without integrations and connect services later. TMDB is still required for Discover/Search metadata.

### Can I change settings after onboarding?
Yes. Everything can be updated in `Settings`.

### Does import overwrite my existing library?
Import behavior depends on matching and dedupe rules; review Library after import and run refresh/reconciliation when needed.
